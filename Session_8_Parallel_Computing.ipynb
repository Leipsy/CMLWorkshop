    "* cluster-helper will act as if a fresh python notebook were started for each job, so it will not inherit your workspace's variables or import statements. **Give each job everything it needs to complete!**\n",
    "* Jobs are still subject to memory limitations, so you may need to **break up large processes into smaller chunks.** For example, each job could correspond to analyzing one session, instead of one subject. \n",
    "* The cluster-helper memory parameter does not work. Supposedly, this will be fixed eventually. If absolutely necessary, you may specify more cores per job to functionally increase the allotted memory. But mind your total core count!\n",
    "* It is often useful to save the output of each job in a dedicated directory, and sometimes useful to save intermediate values to aid in debugging or later nonparallel analyses. The Python \"os\" library can be helpful here. \n",
    "* **Be respectful!** There are only so many cores available to the entire Kahana lab and our collaborators across the country. \n",
    "* **Limit typical jobs to 100 cores or less**. Heavy usage means fewer resources for other users to use, and due to shared disk resources might actually slow down all jobs overall. Please ask for permission before using more.\n",
    "* You can always use the '**qdel**' command in Terminal, followed by your job number, to kill any of your old jobs that may be wasting rhino's resources. \n",
    "* Use the '**qstat**' command in Terminal to see cluster usage information.\n",
