    "In this part you will work with data from a multi-session scalp EEG study\n",
    "of list recall. Table of scalp EEG subjects above provides a list of subject codes\n",
    "that you will use for this assignment.  The first three subjects should be\n",
    "used for Problems 1.1--1.2.  Subsequent problems should use all subject\n",
    "codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load data from three subjects (first three codes in table).\n",
    "    For each subject, first extract the behavioral data and report\n",
    "    basic descriptive statistics including number of sessions\n",
    "    completed, number of lists per session, average number of correctly\n",
    "    recalled items, prior-list intrusions, extra-list intrusions, and\n",
    "    repetitions.  Report these data separately for each subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each of the three initial subjects you will compute a power\n",
    "    spectrum (frequency on the x-axis, power on the y-axis) for recalled\n",
    "    and non-recalled items.  Thus, the goal is to report three graphs (one\n",
    "    for each subject) with line plots indicating recalled events (red) and\n",
    "    non-recalled events (blue).  To do this, first extract all encoding\n",
    "    event (irrespective of recall status) extract the LCF corrected EEG\n",
    "    signal for electrode E53 (left parietal) including a buffer of 1000~ms\n",
    "    on either side of the event and filter out line noise.  For scalp data\n",
    "    contacts are not available from reader.load('contacts'), so you will\n",
    "    need to use reader.load\\_eeg(...) followed by to\\_ptsa() on the\n",
    "    result, and using .channel.values on that result.  Here we will define\n",
    "    the encoding event as the 1600ms that the word was displayed on the\n",
    "    screen, from onset to offset.  The buffer should extend before and\n",
    "    after this period of time.  Check that the EEG data match the number\n",
    "    of trials in the behavioral data.  To compute the power spectrum, you\n",
    "    should use the wavelet transform with wavenumber 6 and compute power\n",
    "    at the following 16 approximately logarithmically-spaced frequencies\n",
    "    (in Hz): 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 17, 25, 35, 50, 72, 103, 147, 210, 300.\n",
    "    The plots should show average power across time and across events for\n",

    "    can we learn from the overall shape of the spectra and the qualitative\n",
    "    (not statistical) differences between encoding conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. In this problem you will repeat the above analysis for all\n",
    "    subjects and make some statistical inferences\n",
    "    about spectral biomarkers of successful memory encoding.  This data\n",
    "    was all acquired with human participants across long stretches of\n",
    "    time, and small things can go wrong.  Be sure that your code is robust\n",
    "    to exceptions that can be thrown, and if you have an exception in a\n",
    "    particular session due to a problem with the data in that session,\n",
    "    print or log the event so you can report it, and discard that session\n",
    "    from the analysis.  Before trying this, please profile your code and\n",
    "    make sure that it is running efficiently.  You should know how much\n",
    "    memory is required to analyze data from each subject and how long it\n",
    "    takes to compute the powers and average across the time samples.\n",
    "    Using the ''cluster helper'' you should be able to use a separate\n",
    "    ''core'' on the cluster to process data from each subject.  Make sure\n",
    "    you save out the power values as you go.  Once you have verified your\n",
    "    code, compute powers for all subjects as described above and create\n",
    "    power spectra for recalled and not-recalled events.  Averaging these\n",
    "    power spectra across subjects, graph the average power spectra with\n",
    "    95\\% confidence bands (transparent light red and light blue shading,\n",
    "    or your favorite clearly-labelled color scheme).  Below the graph\n",
    "    showing the two power spectra, plot the difference between the\n",
    "    spectra, computed separately for each subject, and place a confidence\n",
    "    band on the difference score.  What inferences can you now make from\n",
    "    these results?\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. In this problem, your goal is to assess the effects of several\n",
    "    important processing steps on the analyses in the previous\n",
    "    assignment.  Two common normalization procedures used in the\n",
    "    analysis of brain signals are the log-transform, which attenuates\n",
    "    extremely large values, and the z-transform, which allows you to\n",
    "    normalize power values according to some baseline distribution.\n",
    "    Here you will reproduce the analyses of the previous problem with\n",
    "    and without each of these steps.  The log-transform can be applied\n",
    "    at different points in the analysis stream: immediately after\n",
    "    computing power values, after averaging power values for each\n",
    "    encoding interval, or after computing the z-transform of the\n",
    "    power values.  Similarly, the z-transformation can be done by\n",
    "    normalizing to power (or log-power values) based on many choices\n",
    "    of the ''distribution'' of power (or log-power values).  If our\n",
    "    goal is to normalize data to the distribution of power values\n",
    "    across a given session, how do you define the ''distribution''\n",
    "    over which to estimate the standard deviation of values?  Consider\n",
    "    different choices and assess the effects of these choices on your\n",
    "    final analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. All of the preceding analyses were conducted on a single scalp\n",
    "    electrode.  Here you should repeat the analysis at all electrodes,\n",
    "    generating a topographic map that shows the subsequent memory effect\n",
    "    for the frequency 147~Hz.  For this assignment you should both\n",
    "    log-transform your power values immediately after extracting them, and\n",
    "    z-transform your data based on the distribution of values across each\n",
    "    session (1--23) for each subject.  For the topographic maps, use a\n",
    "    color bar to indicate the difference between power for recalled and\n",
    "    not-recalled items.  Use the across subject t-test method with\n",
    "    Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction to determine which electrodes in\n",
    "    each map meet the $p<0.05$ significance threshold.  Mark statistically\n",
    "    significant electrodes on each topomap with some graphical element\n",
    "    (star, dot, different color shading). **Use the ptsa_plot.ptsa_plot.topo.topoplot function. The ptsa_plot/ptsa_plot/electrode_layouts folder has coordinates for scalp electrode cap contacts.** Discuss your findings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "6. A crucial decision in analyzing EEG data is how one references\n",
    "    the electrical activity: i.e., the EEG measured at a single\n",
    "    channel is a difference in voltage between that channel and a\n",
    "    reference point.  In this problem, you should compare the results\n",
    "    of the previous step under two different referencing schemes: The\n",
    "    default ''average'' reference that comes when you extract the data and\n",
    "    a bipolar reference scheme in which an electrode is referenced to a\n",
    "    nearest neighbor.  For scalp data, since bipolar pairs are not defined\n",
    "    in the dataset with reader.load('pairs'), this requires using the\n",
    "    contacts as explained in problem 1.2 along with the scalp layout\n",
    "    maps to identify suitable neighbors for calculating a bipolar\n",
    "    difference.  Comment on which method is most robust.  Do these\n",
    "    differences depend on the frequency being examined?"
